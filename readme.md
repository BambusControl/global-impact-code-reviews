# Impact of Global Collaboration on Review Speed in Large Projects

## Init Project

Python version is specified in the [.python-version](.python-version) file.
I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) (also for [Windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win)) to manage the python versions.

Initialize Python virtual environment.

```console
python -m venv env
```

```console
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Don't forget to activate the environment.
